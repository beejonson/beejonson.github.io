          <h1>How To Set Up a Personal Weather Station</h1>
          <p>Hi I'm BeeJ  and I am going to show you how to put together a personal weather station and put it on the internet. This way you can show anyone anywhere what the weather conditions are like at your home.</p>

          <p>You can find how hot it got, how cold it was, how much rained and that has a lot of fun. </p>
          
          <p>I am not going to talk about each sensor and what it does. If you are not familiar with them check out this page for <a href="http://weatherbe.weebly.com/blog/automatic-weather-station-operational-features">more info</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Once you decide how much information you need and evaluate your home layout you'll probably need at least 10 different things: </p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>the outside weather sensors </li>
              <li>something to hang onto </li>
              <li>decide whether you need wireless or a cable unit </li>
              <li>four and inside receiving console unit </li>
              <li>logging device to record the information from the console </li>
              <li>then and wire to connect the logger to a computer </li>
              <li>a computer </li>
              <li>software to collect the information and send it to the weather web sites </li>
              <li>webcam whether it's wired or wireless </li>
              <li>webcam software said the images to the Internet</li>
          </ul>
